This project aims to develop a web-based application to manage ongoing events at a University.

Students and Staff: Users can create accounts to access a comprehensive listing of upcoming university events. 
Event Organizers: A dedicated event management dashboard will empower authorized personnel to:
- Create and publish event details including descriptions, dates, and times.
- Manage event registration processes.
- Track participant attendance.

The backend utilizes secure Java Server Pages (JSP) technology for server-side scripting and interacts with a robust SQL database to store and manage user accounts, event information, and registration data. The user interface will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a user-friendly and responsive experience across various devices.
